# KNOW-DEMO

ROS package to create, store, and utilize demonstration-based episodic memories as an ontological knowledge base. This package enables robots to record, organize, and reason about sequential demonstrations of tasks (episodic memories) using structured ontological frameworks, supporting applications like robot learning, behavior introspection, and adaptive long-term task execution.

This package allows to run the knowledge base using rosprolog, which includes features to be used within ROS (e.g., one can query the knowledge base calling a ROS service).
